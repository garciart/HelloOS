# hello-world
Source code for my "Hello, World!" operating system

Ever since Brian Kernighan published "Programming in C â€“ A Tutorial" in 1974, the "hello, world" program has become the Lorem Ipsum of the computer world. Therefore, I decided to make my GitHub debut by writing an operating system that displays the message, "Welcome to the Hello, World OS 1.0!" I hope you enjoy the code!
